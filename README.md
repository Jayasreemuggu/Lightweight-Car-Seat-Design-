# Lightweight-Car-Seat-Design-
 Designed a lightweight car seat by replacing PU foam with EPP/Aerogel, steel with Al/Mg alloys, and back frame with GFRP. Used Pugh Analysis, FEA, and material characterization to assess options by weight, cost, manufacturability, and performance, achieving ~70% weight reduction with structural integrity.
