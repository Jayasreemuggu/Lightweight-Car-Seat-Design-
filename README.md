# Lightweight-Car-Seat-Design
Designed a lightweight car seat by substituting PU foam with EPP/Aerogel foam, steel frame withAluminum/Magnesium alloys, and back frame with GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic).
Applied Pugh Analysis, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and Material characterization to assess alternativesbased on weight, cost, manufacturability, and performance.
Achieved around 70% weight reduction while maintaining structural integrity and long-term durability.
